# auto-clickety-clacker
Basic auto clicker I made for fun and to learn a bit of python with.
Suggestions welcome.

If you would like to change the look that can all be accessed in the design.py file and all logic can be modified in the logic.py.

I've not documented much as it's new to me and will elaborate on things over time when I have a better way of describing things... I've been a career chef/kitchen hand, be gentle.
